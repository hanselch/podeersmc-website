# Pondeers MC Official Website
The official link: https://pondeersmc.netlify.app/

## Breif-Explanation
This is a website created fro a personal project with my other friends. I've maintained it for 3 months, updating a specific page in the website every month with the [uNmINeD](https://unmined.net/) software.

The website was created using the [Astro Framework](https://astro.build/about/), a much more newer XML-esc framework where they use HTML tags in a React-esc format. Making it easier to write multiple lines of code, to faster process the website loads content.
