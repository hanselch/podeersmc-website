    <!-- Question 2. -->
    <details class="faq">
      <summary>What is needed to join the server?</summary>
      <div class="faq-details">
        <p>You must have the following to have a smooth experience with Minecraft.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Minecraft: Java Edition (not cracked, such as Tlauncher and the sort.)</li>
          <li>Optional stuff, but to have optimized and smooth experience:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Fabric API (go to <a href="/install-mods/">Install Mods</a> page to get more info).</li>
            <li>And the <code>necessary.zip</code> mods (again, go to the <a href="/install-mods/">Install Mods</a> page for more info).</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
      </div>

    <!-- Question 3 -->
    <details class="faq">
      <summary>What mods are included that are 'necessary'?</summary>
      <div class="faq-details">
        <p>Go to the <a href="/install-mods/">Install Mods</a> page for more details.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <!-- Question 4 -->
    <details class="faq">
      <summary>Why do I need these mods in the first place?</summary>
      <div class="faq-details">
        <p>Mostly for optimization, but also to add some more quality of life stuff to make it more playable and helpful (they are vanilla friendly so there isn't any mods that will change the gameplay).</p>
        <p>Of course, if you think you don't need mods, the server is still playable without the mods! All of the mods listed are server side mods. meaning that people with the mods will not hurt vanilla players. (Read more <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/feedthebeast/comments/95hfib/client_mods_vs_server_mods_which_are_which/">here</a>.)</p>
