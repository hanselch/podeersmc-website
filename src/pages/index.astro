      <h3>About us.</h3>

      <p>We are a small community of nerds who really love Mincraft, plain and simple! The server is run (and moderated) but both MJ (dosstress) and Hansel (tardiobscurus). Within the MC server, there are (technically) no rule, no set theme, not restriction, and alot of creackhead energy. If you think you are compatible of these ADHD indusing head aches, then ask either MJ or Hansel!</p>

      <h3>Rules</h3>

      <p>There are only 4 rules:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Do not grief</li>
        <li>Do not be a dickhead (unreciprocated bad mouth and related stuff)</li>
        <li>Do not steal (unless the person doesn't mind with)</li>
        <li>And just have fun!</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If you follow these rules, you will have a safe, accepting, and actual fun server!</p>

      <p class="question">Do I need to pay the server? If so, why?</p>

      <p>We are semi-required to have you pay your part of the server. Of course, we will be fair on the pricing and will be splitting it on the direct price by the amount of people</p>

      <p>We will be using the <a href="https://apexminecrafthosting.com/pricing/?game=minecraft" target="_blank">4GB RAM Option</a> to run the server which is 14$. If there are (for example 7 people) we will divide the amount by the price (14 with tax) by the amount of people (7) you will pay your share <b>every month by the ..th of the month</b>.</p>

      <p class="question">Well, what if I couldn't play the server by <i>x</i> amount of time?</p>

      <p>If you won't be able to play the server by less than <b>2 weeks</b> of the month. You will not have the option to pay on that month. Of course you need to tell either MJ (dosstress) or Hansel (tardiobscurus) that you will not be able to play by the afformantioned time frame.</p>
